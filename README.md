# SQL-Leetcode-Challenges
This project showcases my hands-on experience in using SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis. The dataset was analyzed to extract meaningful business insights and identify key performance trends. I used SQL queries such as SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, JOIN, subqueries, and aggregate functions to filter, summarize, and interpret structured data effectively.

The project focuses on understanding patterns, customer behavior, revenue performance, and overall data trends to support data-driven decision-making. Proper data validation and cleaning techniques were applied to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.

This repository demonstrates my ability to work with relational databases, write optimized queries, and convert raw data into actionable insights. It highlights my analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and strong foundation in SQL for real-world business applications.
