# SQL-Leetcode-Challenges
This project demonstrates my practical experience in SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis. I used SQL queries such as SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, JOIN, subqueries, and aggregate functions to extract meaningful insights from structured datasets.

The analysis focuses on identifying customer behavior patterns, revenue trends, and key performance metrics to support data-driven decision-making. Data validation and cleaning techniques were applied to ensure accuracy and reliability.

This repository showcases my ability to work with relational databases, write optimized queries, and convert raw data into actionable business insights while strengthening my analytical and problem-solving skills.
